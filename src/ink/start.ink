mc: I'm amazed that I got a room at all; just two weeks ago they said there was *nothing*.

mc: ...so there. Have I finally scared you away?

mc: I don't want to look at any of them.
mc: A hand gently rubs my back.
sly: You don't really want us to leave, do you?
mc: ?!?!
sly: ...
sly: ...because if you're willing to be honest about whether you want to be here with us or alone elsewhere, *we're* willing to help you either way.
sly: It wasn't your fault.
I burst out crying.
mc: ...I look like such an idiot.
sly: No you don't. And you probably saved your *and* your little sister's lives. If the people coming for your mom had gotten to your house, who *knows* what they would have done to you both.
I can't stop.
steph: You did the best you knew how.
I feel a tissue press against my hands. I suddenly realize that snot is dripping through my fingers. Gross.

<>*Do you* want to stick around us for a while? Or, do you truly want to be left alone? Because we're all willing to deal with this "very dangerous" person.

I feel lighter. A wave of something I'm not sure I've ever felt washes over me.
It's peace; it's rest; it's something different.
Like, even though it'll be hard, maybe I could actually be open here.
I think this is the beginning of what people call...
